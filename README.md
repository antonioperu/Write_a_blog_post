Udacity Project: Write a blog post

Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Motivation: I tried to work on a project that could be a real business case in a company. Therefore, I put myself in the shoes of a company that has to decide where to open an office, and I therefore tried to collect data such as the amount of programmers in a given country, or the average salary the company can expect to have to pay

Summary of results:

This project was conducted on the base of the CRIPS-DM methodology

1)Business understanding: 
A company, wants to know where to find the best programmers hence, where to find a large pool of programmers, therefore the first question is going to be Where do the survey respondents come from?
The second question is going to be, Are salaries dependent (at least in part) from the location of the programmer?
The third question is going to be How much do specific types of companies pay for a professional developer?

2) Data understanding
Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 2017, a yearly survey conducted by stack overflow, collecting data on anything from programming languages to salaries to code styles and other topics. In 2017, they collected almost 64,000 replies from 213 different nations.

3) Data preparation
This process included downloading and reading the data (a csv file), understating the structure of the data (i.e. the shape, the columns, etc), focusing on the data of interest and deciding which libraries to use

4) Data modeling
No machine learning was used in the project, only descriptive statistics

5) Evaluation

1 ) Where do the survey respondents come from?: most respondents are from either affluent countries (with the united states by far in the lead) or populous countries, such as India (in second place with more respondents) or Russia.
2) Are salaries dependent (at least in part) from the location of the programmer? Definetly yes, with the United States and other affluent countries leading the ranking of the countries offering the best salaries.
3) How much do specific types of companies pay for a professional developer? Publicly traded companies (and private companies in general) pays better salary than state-owned companies
